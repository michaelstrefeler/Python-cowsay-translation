This project is a python translatation of my favorite Linux package cowsay by Tony Monroe.

## TODO

* ~~Add the ability to show help with cowsay -h~~
* Add other "cows"
* ~~Add cowsay -l to list all the cows~~
* Add the different optional parameters like -g to replace eyes with $$ and more
* Optimize code
